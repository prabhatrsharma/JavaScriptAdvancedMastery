// Topic: 3.2.33 Object as a Composite Data Structure

// Objects, along with the Object constructor, serve as a composite data structure in JavaScript.

/*Arrays:
- Arrays are collections of elements where elements can be repeated.
- Elements in an array are identified by their position (index), and the order of elements is significant.
- Arrays are suitable for storing data where order and repetition are important.*/

/*Sets:
- Sets are collections of unique elements, meaning each element appears only once within the set.
- Sets do not have indexes, and while they maintain an order, this order does not impact the set's operations.
- Sets are ideal for storing unique data and are not concerned with element position.*/

/*Maps:
- Maps store key-value pairs, where each key in the map must be unique.
- Map elements consist of a key and its corresponding value, allowing for efficient data retrieval based on keys.
- The order of elements in a map is not significant, similar to sets.*/

/*Object Properties:
- Objects can have properties that act as key-value pairs, similar to maps.
- Each property key in an object must be unique, and it is used to access or retrieve the associated value.
- Objects can store data of various types, making them versatile for representing complex data structures.*/

/*Conclusion:
- Arrays, sets, maps, and objects are all composite data structures with unique characteristics.
- The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the data being stored and accessed.
- Understanding the differences between these data structures helps in efficient data management and manipulation in JavaScript.*/
