Using for ... in, we can go through the properties of an object.
More precisely â€“ we go through the names of the properties, (i.e. the keys).
Let's display the property names of the contact object.

The names of all the properties (keys) of the contact object are assigned to the variable x in turn.
To get to the value of a given field, we use bracket notation (the key is dynamically calculated and placed in the variable, so we cannot use dot notation).

/* Finally, if we would like to display the name, type, and value of all the properties, we could write it as follows: */
