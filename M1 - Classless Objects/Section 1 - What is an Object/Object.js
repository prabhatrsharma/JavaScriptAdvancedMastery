How do they differ from ordinary arrays? We donâ€™t refer to the individual elements of an object by means of indexes, which define their position in the collection, but by means of keys (i.e. we "associate" an element with a key).

A key is simply a label (a name), which is unique within an object and unambiguously defines the selected element.

In objects, we call their component elements properties. Each property will consist of a key (or label) and a value.

The idea of objects comes from observing the surrounding reality. Practically everything in our environment, whether material (e.g. a car) or abstract (e.g. a contact in an address book) is a collection of certain components.

We can name these elements, or properties, and assign them specific values. Properties define a given object.
