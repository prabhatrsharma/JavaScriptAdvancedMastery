// 4.2.1 Generators and iterators

// The concept of iterators and generators was imported from functional languages and is now implemented in many general-purpose languages.

// In JavaScript, both iterators and generators appeared with ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ECMAScript 6 or ES6).

// To begin with, it may be helpful to introduce the concept of iterable objects.

// These are usually collections of data through which we can "iterate" (i.e., pass through successive elements).

// There are several built-in iterable objects in JavaScript, such as Array, Map, and Set.

// Suppose we declare an object of type Set that will contain two numeric elements, then add two more elements to it.

let s = new Set([1, 30]);
s.add(500);
s.add(50);

/*
Object s is a typical iterable object. 
It contains four elements that can be accessed using the techniques we just mentioned. 
First, we use the for ... of statement:
*/
for (let e of s) {
    console.log(e); // Output: 1 30 500 50
}

// Using the spread operator, we can transform an iterable object into an array:
console.log([...s]); // Output: [1, 30, 500, 50]

// or split it into individual arguments passed to the function:
console.log(...s); // Output: 1 30 500 50

/*
We can also create an iterator, which is an object that is something like a pointer to a particular item in the collection, and use it to pass through our object s.
*/
let it = s[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(it.next().value); // Output: 1
console.log(it.next().value); // Output: 30
console.log(it.next().value); // Output: 500
console.log(it.next()); // Output: {done: false, value: 50}

/*
While the for ... of statement or the spread operator are already known to you, 
the iterator used in the last example is certainly something new.
*/
// Let’s devote some more of our time to it.
